# In order to compute the number of cases that fall within each subinterval
# linear programming is used.
# There is a variable for each subinterval that indicates how many cases occur
# within it.
# The contraints are formed by the incident intervals. The number cases in the 
# subintervals an interval contains must sum to at least the number of cases in
# the interval.
# The objective function minimizes the following objectives
# by weighting the objectives that should take priority higher.
# 1. The sum of the maximum case rate in each interval.
# 2. The sum of the sum of all the subintervals in each interval.
# 3. The negative minimum case rate.
# I arrived at this function by first trying only using the second objective
# to make the solution fit the incident reports as closely as possible.
# That often lead to solutions where cases were not distributed evenly across
# subintervals, so I introduced the first and third objectives.
# The first objective was initially a secondary objective.
# However, when inconsistent counts were used - for instance, 
# an interval with 100 cases inside an interval with only 10 cases -
# objective 2 would override the other objectives and cause problems
# where counts were distributed unevenly.
