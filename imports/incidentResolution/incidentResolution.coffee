# In order to compute the number of cases that fall within each subinterval
# linear programming is used.
# There is a variable for each subinterval that indicates how many cases occur
# within it.
# The constraints are formed by the incident intervals. The number of cases in the 
# subintervals an interval contains must sum to at least the number of cases in
# the interval.
# The objective function minimizes the following objectives
# by weighting the objectives that should take priority higher:
#
# 1. The sum of the maximum case rates in each interval.
# 2. The sum of the sum of all the subinterval counts in each interval.
# 3. The negative minimum case rate.
#
# I arrived at this function by attempting to make the solution fit the
# incident reports as closely as possible. At first I only used the second
# objective. However, it often lead to solutions where cases were not
# distributed evenly across subintervals.
# To see an example of the uneven distribution problem, imagine minimizing the
# subinterval counts of I1 and I3 from the plot above. Without an incentive
# to evenly distribte their counts, an optimal soultion could allocate
# zero cases to the D subintervals by overinflating the others or vice versa.
# To remidy this, I introduced the first and third objectives.
# They are designed to press the minimum and maximum rates of the intervals
# together and prevent all the cases in an incident from being unevely allocated
# to the maximum rate subintervals when they could be allocated to others.
# The first objective was initially a secondary objective.
# However, when inconsistent counts were used - for instance, 
# an interval with 100 cases inside an interval with only 10 cases -
# objective 2 would override the other objectives and cause problems
# where counts were distributed unevenly.
